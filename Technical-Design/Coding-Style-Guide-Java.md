## Naming Conventions
  + **1.1 CamelCase**
      + Java class, field, method, and variable names follow the CamelCase convention, where words are concatenated, and the initial letter of each word is capitalized.
      + For variable names the first letter should remain lowercase
          + EX: String myDog
