# Implementation Framework: JavaFX

**Reasons for selecting JavaFX:**

  + **Integration with Java**: Since our implementation language is Java, JavaFX seamlessly integrates with Java code, allowing for a cohesive development experience.

  + **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: JavaFX applications can run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This aligns with our goal of platform independence, ensuring a consistent user experience across different operating systems.

  + **Scene Builder Tool**: JavaFX comes with a visual layout tool called Scene Builder, which facilitates the design of UIs through a drag-and-drop interface. This accelerates the UI development process.

  + **Rich User Interface**: JavaFX provides a powerful set of features for creating visually appealing user interfaces. Its support for rich graphics, multimedia, and animations makes it suitable for building engaging UIs.

By selecting JavaFX as our framework, we aim to leverage its capabilities for creating an interactive and platform-independent user interface.
