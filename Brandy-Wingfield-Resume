## Experience
#### Programming (2022 - Present)
I am majoring in Computer Science and took many math and programming classes along the way. I have been coding in java for over a year now. I have taken two intro level programing classes that introduced me to loops, methods, and object-oriented programming. I also took a data structures class, which taught me how to use nodes, and manipulate tables. Other than Java, I have coded assignments in Python, C#, and R.
